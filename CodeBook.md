<h3>Standard prefixes and suffixes of the fields' names:</h3>

| Name  | Example | Meaning |
| ----: | ------- | ------- |
| Body  | Time.Body.Acc.Z    |         |
| Freq | Freq.Body.AccJerk.Y | |
| Gravity | Time.Gravity.AccMag | |
| StdErr | Time.Body.GyroMag.StdErr | Standard error of the value |
| Time | Time.Body.AccJerk.Z | Timer-base value: captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then it's filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz |
| X | Time.Body.GyroJerk.X | Value (vector) along X axis |
| Y | Time.Body.Gyro.StdErr.Y | Value (vector) along Y axis |
| Z | Time.Gravity.Acc.Z| Value (vector) along Z axis |
